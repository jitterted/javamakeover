# Learn Java

Named after the subreddit at reddit.com/r/learnjava,
this project has a series of mini-projects that start
with code posted by novices and then refactors to
better code, where better is:

* Intention-revealing names
* Objects that are cohesive
* Short(er) methods and classes
* Separation of "domain" logic from technical and infrastructure concerns
* last, but not least, unit tests
